    Name of Game: Stop and smell the roses (A Self-Portrait)
    Genre: Racing, Platformer
    Reference: Dinorun

    Summary:
    
    A game where you must run to finish line. The whole game takes place in one level. After the player reaches the end, the game reloads to the beginning of the game. 
    You are constantly getting chased by a dark fog. If you touch the dark fog you die. 
    Roses are scattered around the map, they do not provide anything to the player other than a nice change of scenery from this otherwise barren and empty level.
    
    Symbolism:
    
    Dark fog: The dark thoughts that cloud my mind (depression, past ETC)
    Roses: The light in the darkness.
    The player’s journey: My journey
    
    Message:
    
    Sometimes(Maybe it’s just me), you don’t want to deal with your personal struggles/disruptive thoughts. 
    You ignore them and constantly keep yourself busy so that these thoughts don’t get to you. Sadly, you can’t run forever from your thoughts (dark fog). 
    There’s nothing wrong with grappling these thoughts and shouldn’t be something to be ignored. You can learn from these experiences and grow. 
    The roses act as a period of reflection, that there is beauty in slowing things down and put things in perspective. 
    However you can’t dwell on them for too long, you need to move on and grow from this experience before it ends up consuming you.
